I made this shit completely with AI, dont care about code bc didnt have time.

What does it do?

It puts a massive, un-closable shield on your screen so your colleagues can't mess with your Mac when you go to grab a coffee to ait for your computer to finish some reeeally important stuff like scans, builds whatever you are "working" on. It also keeps your Mac awake (preventing sleep) so these tasks don't die.

Features:
 - Fullscreen Shield: Blocks clicks and covers everything (Dock, Menu Bar, Mission Control).
 - Custom Messages: Type whatever threat you want on the screen.
 - Menu Bar Toggle: Activate/Deactivate from the menu bar.
 - Emergency Exit: Double-click the shield to dismiss it.

How to use:
 - Run the app.
 - Type a message in the control panel.
 - Click "Activate Shield" or use the Menu Bar icon.
 - Walk away.
 - Double-click the shield to unlock when you return.
